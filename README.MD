# rdr2-maps
*A collection of maps showing locations for several rare/uncommon animals.*

### The Objective

These are current maps of my own edition, all noting locations of numerous animal species (listed below). I verify all locations myself at least twice. Animals which are fast on their feet/feathers are tracked back to their original location before they moved. (That has proven to be difficult at times, but I'm shooting for quality rather than quantity.) All verified locations are marked with red circles.

<u>**NOTE:**</u> The releases will be in 7z format, so you'll need an archiving program capable of extracting 7-zip archives. I use [7-zip itself](https://www.7-zip.org/), but you're free to use whatever you want.

Here's the maps I've included:

- Western Bull Moose and Western (Cow) Moose
- Cougars, Panthers, and Florida Panthers (All-In-One)
- Grizzly Bears
- Timber Wolves
- Little Brown Bats
- Rival Gang Camps/Hideouts/Ambushes
- Places where you can "Sit"

The file **TIMESTAMPS.MD** contains, well... timestamps *and* location-specific information for each spawn location.

<u>**NOTE:**</u> Panther locations were integrated into the cougar map as panthers have only two localized spawn areas. That being the case, I felt no need for an entire map just for a few locations within a dense area. Besides, cougars don't spawn in Lemoyne anyway, so the locations in Lemoyne are guaranteed to be panthers.

<u>**NOTE:**</u> Night Folk encounter locations have been added to **RDR2-RivalGangs.jpg**. They are localized to **Lagras** and **Lakay**.

### Map Key/Legend

As promised.

COLOR | SPAWN TYPE
:--- | ---
Solid Red | Enemy Hideout (Gang Locations Only)
Red | Static Spawn<br>Enemy Campsite
Blue | Random Encounter (Animal & Enemy)

### Roadmap

I'm marking owl locations only in New Austin as [there is already a map of most locations outside of New Austin](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/d/d4/Owl_habitats_-_Red_Dead_2.png).

### Contributing

If you're a story mode maniac like myself and have proof of a location of any of the aforementioned which I've yet to document, I welcome your findings. Please include a full timestamp in a format like so: **year-month-day-hour-minute-weather** of your in-game time as of the encounter. You can get a timestamp like that by navigating to **World > Time** in **RampageTrainer**. I'm unsure if it's possible without mods, though. However, in which case (namely if you're on console), provide the timestamp in this alternative format: **hour-minute-weather**. If you use 12-hour time format, simply add either an `a` (if AM) or `p` (if PM).

### Testing Procedures and Constants

- PC v1436 locked at 60fps, V-Sync off, Triple Buffering on, mostly medium settings aside from low lighting qualities and ultra textures
- Level four bonded Silver Dapple Pinto MFT with Panther Trapper Saddle.
- Perlino Andalusian and White Arabian stabled.

*Started a new playthrough. Outfit, loadout, and progression don't appear to affect static animal spawns.*
