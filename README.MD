# rdr2-maps
*A collection of maps showing locations for several rare/uncommon animals.*

### The Objective

These are current maps of my own edition, all noting locations of numerous animal species (listed below). I verify all locations myself at least twice. Animals which are fast on their feet/feathers are tracked back to their original location before they moved. (That has proven to be difficult at times, but I'm shooting for quality rather than quantity.) All verified locations are marked with red circles.

### Roadmap

I'm marking owl locations only in New Austin as [there is already a map of most locations outside of New Austin](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/d/d4/Owl_habitats_-_Red_Dead_2.png). I plan to change random encounter (special) locations to blue (or some other color). As for the rival gang map, different colors for different scenarios. For example, red for hideouts, blue for camps, green for random encounters/ambushes, etc. (Again, that is coming in the near future as I continue to catalogue all of this.) Yes, I will be including a key in each image, but for now it's just bare locations all marked in red. Animal maps' locations are marked as 10px smaller than "Sit" locations as, again, I'm trying to be as precise as possible.

Here's the maps I've included:

- Western Bull Moose and Western (Cow) Moose
- Cougars
- Panthers and Florida Panthers
- Grizzly Bears
- Timber Wolves
- Little Brown Bats
- Rival Gang Camps/Hideouts/Ambushes
- Places where you can "Sit"

The file **"TIMESTAMPS.MD"** contains, well... timestamps *and* location-specific information for each spawn location.

**NOTE:** Panther locations were integrated into the cougar map as panthers have only two localized spawn areas. That being the case, I felt no need for an entire map just for a few locations within a dense area. Besides, cougars don't spawn in Lemoyne anyway, so the locations in Lemoyne are guaranteed to be panthers.

### Contributing

If you're a story mode maniac like myself and have proof of a location of any of the aforementioned which I've yet to document, I welcome your findings. Please include a full timestamp in a format like so: **year-month-day-hour-minute-weather** of your in-game time as of the encounter. You can get a timestamp like that by navigating to **World > Time** in **RampageTrainer**. I'm unsure if it's possible without mods, though. However, in which case (namely if you're on console), provide the timestamp in this alternative format: **hour-minute-weather**. If you use 12-hour time format, simply add either an `a` (if AM) or `p` (if PM).
