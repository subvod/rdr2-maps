### Some Notes

- Text within quotes, for example `"Willard's Rest"`, signifies text on the overworld (pause menu) map. Actual, in-game locations are noted in bold and not in quotes or a code block, as such: **Willard's Rest**. When describing placement relative to individual letters, the associated text will be in quotes and the individual letter(s) mentioned will be bolded. For example: west edge of the 'a' in "Will**a**rd's Rest".
- All reference locations (nearby plants, landmarks, etc) used are those which are the closest to where the animal was spotted. I try not to be vague, like "large rock next to the mountain". I try to give however much detail is there. Some spawnpoints were a ways away from notable locations, and in those cases I've noted only landmarks and/or plants nearest to the spawnpoint as well as the animal's location relative to them.
- Random encounters have been almost exclusive to daytime for me. I've seen maybe five encounters after dark, three of which being cougars attacking deer, one being a cougar attacking two NPCs on the Kamassa, and the last I can remember being grizzly versus wolves at Barrow around 02:00.
- Random encounters seem to appear more frequently if you reload in a nearby location or spend a great amount of time in the general vicinity. This includes all random encounters. Cool to watch once in a while.
- The chace of random encounters does not change at any point if story mode, contrary to what I suspected. In `Simple Pleasures`, **Abe** says something I feel leans towards this being an actual mechanic put into the game for post-story play: "It’s changed. Rich fellers are coming in and buying everything… the ranches… but… well, it ain’t as wild as it once were, at least." [[Citation.]](#quotes) But, after extensive testing, random encounters are just as random regardless of story progression.
- **Panther** locations were integrated into the Cougar map as panthers have only two localized spawn areas. That being the case, I felt no need for an entire map just for a few locations within a dense area. Besides, cougars don't spawn in Lemoyne anyway, so locations marked in Lemoyne (`RDR2-CougarPanther.jpg`) are guaranteed to be **Panthers**.

### Rival Gangs

- O'Driscolls and Laramies share some of the same random encounter locations.
- The gang around Saint Denis are goons serving **Guido Martelli** (as per **Charles** during `Bare Knuckle Friendships`). [[Citation.]](#quotes) They don't have a known hideout, but are localized to parts of Saint Denis and appear in only random encounters.

## Animal Locations

### Western Bull Moose / Western Moose

*Three unique coats: dark brown (almost black), rust brown (almost orange), and a gray-brown. Pelts yielded by each are incorrect. Example, a rust brown bull yields a pelt that should have come from a gray-brown bull. Possibly associated with dodgy spawns.*

**NOTE:** The most reliable spawns from my experience: Witches Cauldron (OOB spawns), Tall Trees (second 'L'). They're 24-hour spawn points and allow all coats and both genders to spawn. Every other static spawn may as well be considered a random encounter given how rarely even I've come across them.

**NOTE:** Unsure if a glitch, but (aside from known unique coat spawns) every bull I run across is rust-brown and every cow I come across is gray-brown.

**NOTE:** Random encounters include: swimming across bodies of water being chased by lone wolf, attempting to stand up on ice.

**NOTE:** If you spend enough time close by, you can get two moose to spawn on the west side of **Lake Isabella**. It's happened to me only once (using RampageTrainer's time advance feature), so quite rare but possible nonetheless.

- Colter, Grizzlies West, AM (atop small cliff on southeast side of road running northeast out of **Colter**; 06:27, 14:41)
- Lake Isabella, Grizzlies West, AM (beside path on west side of **Lake Isabella**; unaffected by **White Arabian** presence; unaffected by playing wolves random encounter; 09:13, 15:32, 18:40)
- Lake Isabella, Grizzlies West, AM (laying on ice northwest side of **Lake Isabella**; southeast of destroyed cabin; just some paces away from the spawn described above; 06:24)
- Lake Isabella, Grizzlies West, AM (chased by wolf across northwestern **Lake Isabella**; swims to northern shore just southeast of waterfall; 17:45)
- Cairn Lake, Grizzlies West, AM (laying on ice in center of **Cairn Lake**; 06:55, 16:32, 19:27)
- Barrow Lagoon, Grizzlies West, AM (laying on ice southeast side of lagoon; 08:20, 10:45)
- Window Rock, Grizzlies West, AM (west side of train tracks atop cliff overlooking trestle bridge southwest of **Window Rock**; southwest of the trestle bridge itself; dead west of "Dodd's Bluff"; dead south of "Chez Porter"; northeast of dreamcatcher)
- Calumet Ravine, Grizzlies East, AM (west shore of lake next to junctions running east out of **Wapiti Indian Reservation**)
- Calumet Ravine, Grizzlies East, AM (swimming west across the south side of the lake being chased by wolf; directly in line with junction east of **Wapiti**; 14:45)
- Fort Wallace, Cumberland Forest, NH (east of **Fort Wallace**; in trees on west side of road at first junction south of **Bacchus Station**; 10:17-15:01)
- Witches Cauldron, Grizzlies East, AM (west of **Witches Cauldron**; between 'I' and 'N' in "AMBAR**IN**O"; northeast of junction by **Strange Statues**; OOB, but can be lured with bait or by rolling the dice spooking it; alternative coats spawn here; 24-hour)
- Witches Cauldron, Grizzlies East, AM (same as above, but about 100m east-southeast; the spawn is far enough out that the moose doesn't move for anything or anyone; inaccessible from anywhere around, but you can shoot it from the mountain across the path; unknown if nearby OOB access is possible; 24-hour)
- O'Creagh's Run, Grizzlies East, AM (east shoreline of lake; just south of **Veteran's Homestead**; 15 paces west of Alaskan Ginseng plant; to the east of "O'Creagh's" in "**O'Creagh's** Run"; 14:00-17:00)
- O'Creagh's Run, Grizzlies East, AM (near north shoreline of lake; swims south in line with "Cr" in "O'**Cr**eagh's Run" to northeast edge of western peninsula)
- Fairvale Shanty, Grizzlies East, AM (in grass on south side of road; southwest of **Fairvale Shanty**; sleep until morning at **The Loft**; 06:49, 12:32)
- Willard's Rest, Roanoke Ridge, NH (inside 3-way junction just southeast of "Rest" in "Willard's **Rest**"; north side of train tracks; 07:48, 13:15, 18:38)
- Brandywine Drop, Roanoke Ridge, NH (east side of river; edge of first cliff up from river at waterfall; west of first 'R' in "**R**OANOKE RIDGE"; 08:15)
- Beaver Hollow, Roanoke Ridge, NH (hillside east of path running northwest from **Beaver Hollow**)

- Evelyn Miller Camp, Tall Trees, WE (directly east of second 'L' in "TAL**L** TREES"; next to a **Lady Slipper Orchid**; alternative coats spawn here; 24-hour)
- Bear Claw, Tall Trees, WE (second 'E' in "TALL TRE**E**S"; occasionally a random NPC campsite spawns 20m away which seems to disable the moose spawn, if otherwise I never see both of them at the same time)
- Aurora Basin, Tall Trees, WE (between two groups of Burdock Root on the northwest side of **Aurora Basin**; northeast of Skinner Brothers campsite which, if present, will disable moose spawn)
- Aurora Basin, Tall Trees, WE (out-of-bounds atop small cliff on the southwest end of **Aurora Basin**; west side of **Lower Montana River**; may sometimes fall backwards and remain out-of-bounds; draw it out with Herbivore Bait like with the OOB Ambarino moose; 06:00)

### Panther

*Three coats: two of the ordinary Panther and one of the Florida Panther. All are relatively similar, while the Florida panther has a paler coat than the regular Panther.*

**NOTE:** All coats of the **Panther** and **Florida Panther** spawn at both **Old Harry Fen** and (north of) **Lakay**.

- Old Harry Fen, Scarlett Meadows, LE (southeast of **Old Harry Fen**; southwest of tri-junction; 24-hour)
- Lakay, Bayou Nwa, LE (eastern bank of **Kamassa River**; sleeping at water's edge northeast of **Lakay**; 22:00-04:00)
- *Macomb's End, Bayou Nwa, LE (alleged online-only spawn; somewhere around Macomb's End; possibly farther north like east of Pleasance)*
- *Stillwater Creek, Hennigan's Stead, NA (alleged online-only spawn; largest inlet of the creek; east of Stillwater Cabin)*

### Owl

**NOTE:** Owls spawn 16:00-06:00. At 21:00, miscellaneous birds (Ravens, Crows, Sparrows, etc) no longer fly overhead. Conversely, at 05:00, those birds begin flying again. Having no excess birds makes owls easier to spot, as anything flying in that time frame is almost guaranteed to be an owl. The only exceptions are hawks, eagles, and ravens which only fly at night when there's a carcass/corpse nearby. But, here's a caveat I noticed: from 18:00-21:00 there seems to be way more perched (standing, stationary) owls around pretty much everywhere I've tested (very noticable difference when rooting around in Tall Trees). I've not observed the same effect during the early morning.

**NOTE:** Coastal and Great Horned can be found across the entire map despite name implications. (I've found Coastals all the way up at Cairn Lake.) Owls in New Austin are usually Californians, with a few Great Horned here and there, but rarely Coastals out there. I think I've killed five or six in New Austin since I got the game. Far as I can tell, the Californian is exclusive to New Austin until I'm proven otherwise. Some players have noted finding it around **Lone Mule Stead** (Big Valley, WE), **Bear Claw** (Tall Trees, WE), and the marsh flats around **Canebreak Manor** (Bluewater Marsh, LE).

**NOTE:** According to GTABase, the areas with the highest concentration of Owl spawns are (highest to lowest): Tall Trees, slightly north of Strawberry, the whole stretch of the Little Creek River (from Hanging Dog Ranch to Sheperd's Rise), Cumberland Falls, the Heartlands Trading Post (landmark located northwest of Gill's Landing), and Cumberland Forest (in its entirety). I can verify Tall Trees is the best for Owl hunting in general, but pre-Epilogue I've killed plenty of Great Horned and Coastals in and around Cumberland Forest while hunting Timber Wolves.

- Strawberry, Big Valley, WE (southwest of Strawberry; in tree east of first 'p' in "U**p**per Montana River")
- Chez Porter, Grizzlies West, AM (on a wooden bridge south of the cabins)
- Fairvale Shanty, Grizzlies East, AM (atop a rock directly south of the shanty; north side of road)
- Cumberland Falls, Big Valley, WE (west cliffside)
- Elysian Pool, Roanoke Ridge, NH (atop dead tree in pool)
- Canebreak Manor, Bluewater Marsh, LE (flying over the entire area of marsh flats to the north; alleged Californian Spawn)
- Flat Iron Lake, Scarlett Meadows, LE (small southernmost island; west of Braitewaite Manor)
- Flat Iron Lake, Scarlett Meadows, LE (largest island with beached shipwreck; west of Braitewaite Manor)
- Lone Mule Stead, Big Valley, WE (atop cabin; alleged Californian spawn)
- Tanner's Reach, Tall Trees, WE (atop chimney; before and after Evelyn Miller stranger mission series completion)
- Bear Claw, Tall Trees, WE (atop three of the old cabins; another perched on cliff just to the west; alleged Californian spawn)
- Coots Chapel, Cholla Springs, NA (atop chapel; also on a cactus just out front)
- Rathskeller Fork, Gaptooth Ridge, NA
- Two Crows, Cholla Springs, NA (atop wagon)
- Ridgewood Farm, Cholla Springs, NA (atop barn)
- Silent Stead, Gaptooth Ridge, NA (atop cabin)
- *Emerald Ranch, Heartlands, NH (supposedly in or on a barn on the west side of the ranch)*
- *Manteca Falls, Hennigan's Stead, NA (supposedly all around the falls)*

### Timber Wolf

**NOTE:** Timbers are very much localized to **Cotorra Springs** and **Cumberland Forest**, but can be found in a few places outside its main habitat. On those fringe locations, every Timber I've encountered was in a team of two. Wolf ambush locations seem to randomly spawn either Timbers or Grays, but the sparse locations in New Austin seem to yield only Grays thus far.

- Cairn Lake, Grizzlies West, AM (south side of path; west of lake)
- Lake Isabella, Grizzlies West, AM (west side of path; north of lake)
- Barrow Lagoon, Grizzlies West, AM (west side of path; south of lagoon)
- Cotorra Springs, Grizzlies East, AM (east side of easternmost path aside hot springs)
- Veteran's Homestead, Grizzlies East, AM (peninsula south of cabin)
- *Fairvale Shanty, Grizzlies East, AM (south side of road atop hill; seen video evidence but not encountered one there myself)*
- *Hanging Dog Ranch, Big Valley, WE (north of the ranch; iirc wolves spawn east of the path)*
- *Clawson's Rest, Grizzlies West, AM (east of Clawson's; between 'a' and 'k' of "Dakota River")*
- *Owanjila, Big Valley, WE (somewhere along the paths running east towards Strawberry)*

### Cougar

**NOTE:** Cougars are primarily nocturnal, but they can and will spawn during the day. Best hunting I've done is 22:00-04:00.

**NOTE:** Hotspots for cougars are up in the northeast corner of the map (Roanoke Ridge, NH) and north of Ridgewood Farm (Cholla Springs, NA). I've bagged three cougars in three minutes at each, but the spawns north of Ridgewood are more dense. Otherwise, Roanoke Ridge is the next best.

**NOTE:** Random encounters include: attacking and eating deer, stalking/attacking NPCs. These appear to occur more often in the daytime.

- Pronghorn Ranch, Big Valley, WE (north side of path north of last 'h' in "Pronghorn Ranc**h**")
- Valley View, Big Valley, WE (attacking deer; south of last 'e' in "Little Creek Riv**e**r"; 23:05)
- Black Bone Forest, Big Valley, WE (creek bank feeding into **Owanjila**; west of **Native Burial**; between path and creek)
- Black Bone Forest, Big Valley, WE (southeast side of path; northwest of **Native Burial**; 07:15)
- Doverhill, Roanoke Ridge, NH (spawns on path on west bank of **Kamassa River**; north of train tracks; creeps up to NPC campsite)
- Roanoke Valley, Roanoke Ridge, NH (there are a ton of spawns between **Black Balsan Rise** and **Doverhill**; fewer spawns west of the **Kamassa River**)
- Cochinay, Tall Trees, WE (northwest of first 'T' in "**T**ALL TREES"; 24-hour)
- Beecher's Hope, Great Plains, WE (east of 'G' in "**G**REAT PLAINS")
- Quaker's Cove, Great Plains, WE (between 'N' and 'S' in "GREAT PLAI**NS**")
- Rathskeller Fork, Gaptooth Ridge, NA (southeast of **Rathskeller**, technically in **Cholla Springs**; there's a ton of spawns between 'C' and second 'L' in "**C**HOL**L**A SPRINGS")
- Rathskeller Fork, Gaptooth Ridge, NA (south of **Rathskeller**; northeast corner of junctions north of 'G' in "GAPTOOTH RID**G**E"; west of rabbit map icon)
- Plainview, Rio Bravo, NA (southwest of **Plainview**; in land depression on north side of path beyond junctions located west of **Plainview**; north-northeast of last 'R' in "SAN LUIS RIVE**R**"; at the base of a rocky hill)
- Benedict Point, Rio Bravo, NA (dead west of **Solomon's Folly**; dead south of the 'i' in "Benedict Po**i**nt"; 15:15)
- *Moonstone Pond, Grizzlies East, AM (west-northwest of pond)*
- *Bear Claw, Tall Trees, WE (north or west of Bear Claw)*
- *Quaker's Cove, Great Plains, WE (southwest of 'H' in "WEST ELIZABETH")*
- *Macfarlane's Ranch, Hennigan's Stead, NA (north of Macfarlane's; south shore of Lower Montana River)*
- *Benedict Point, Rio Bravo, NA (southeast of Benedict; seems to be two or three spawns around there according to maps)*
- *Cueva Seca, Gaptooth Ridge, NA (somewhere near the legendary cougar?)*

### Grizzly Bear

**NOTE:** Grizzlies appear to be primarily daytime animals, but I've encountered a few well past midnight. Most notably at the spawns within Black Bone Forest.

**NOTE:** Sometimes during bear versus wolves random encounters, wolves may not spawn and the bear may just be munching on a corpse.

**NOTE:** Random encounter scenarios: catching salmon, eating deer carcass while fighting wolves.

**NOTE:** Unique encounters are different from random encounters as they occur only once.

- Barrow Lagoon, Grizzlies West, AM (north of 'a' in "L**a**goon"; eating deer carcass, 10:40, 13:25)
- Barrow Lagoon, Grizzlies West, AM (between 'o' and 'n' in "Lago**on**"; eating deer carcass, 09:38, 10:32, 16:15)
- Cattail Pond, Grizzlies West, AM (just east of the pond; eating deer carcass)

- *Window Rock, Grizzlies West, AM (southeast of Window Rock; possibly on south shore of Dakota or northwest edge of Cumberland Forest)*

### Little Brown Bat

**NOTE:** Bats spawn from 16:00-06:00.

## Extended Information

*Reference links to documents/maps that were used, among other things.*

### Testing Procedures

- PC v1436 locked at 60fps, V-Sync off, Triple Buffering on, mostly medium settings aside from low lighting qualities and ultra textures.
- Perlino Andalusian and White Arabian stabled.
- All animals are tracked back to their original locations via **Eagle Eye**. All locations shown were verified at least twice before being marked.
- Constant application of **Cover Scent Lotion**, as in once every 2-3 minutes.
- Dismount horse well away from spawn.
- Slow approach, normal crouched walking.
- RampageTrainer (freeze/change time/weather; 2021/12/05 using Ignored By Wild Animals to pinpoint exact spawn locations)

*Started a new playthrough. Outfit, loadout, and progression don't appear to affect static animal spawns.*

### Release Format

The releases are 7z format with LZMA2 compression, so you'll need an archiving program capable of extracting LZMA2 7-zip archives. I use [7-zip itself](https://www.7-zip.org/), but you're free to use whatever you want.

In-game screenshots of the player sitting at a "sit" location are uploaded in their own, separate archives with the suffix `SitLocationsInGame` (i.e. `rdr2-maps-2021-11-07-SitLocationsInGame.7z`).
